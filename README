The highlighting principle is sensitivity over specificity.
The differences between this file and the prior highlighting syntax file are:

Add syntax file folding;
Add an option to highlight the keywords based on the base package only or based on various contributed packages also;
Add some rFunction per some distributions;
Revise rType based on latest R (Ver 2.10.1) manual;
Add rPreProc;
Correct rArrow with rOperator according to R manual.

Maintainer contacted but no response. So I upload a new one here.
